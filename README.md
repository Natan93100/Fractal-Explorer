# Nathan Ben David - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi! I'm Nathan, a young motivated Data Analyst looking for his next endeavor.<br>A lil about me before we jump to qualifications and so;
I like Data, Seriously, i Do!<br>
I Enjoy going on to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) every now and then, exploring a random data set,
analysing it, and come up with my own conclusions regarding it; Sometimes i'll even have business ideas based solely on the SQL analysis of the database.<br>
Besides that weird hobby of mine (right?!), I enjoy statsitics (especially weird correlations like in here : [tylervigen.com](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations))
and the Brain Science Field (if you do also, I HIGHLY encourage you to give 'The Brain That Changes Itself a read) as well as modelling data regarding that field using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn Libraries in Python.<br>
professionaly speaking, I hold a B.sc of Economics with a minor in Data-Science; During my studies, I gained the ability to work with complex data and developed an eye for identifying patterns and trends.<br> I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.<br>
Besides my acadmic knowledge and tools, I also have a proffesional background in working as a data analyst where I gained most of my knowledge, skills and tools.
## Skills used:
- **Python Modeling**: Machine learning, data preprocessing, and automation
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability


# Fractal Explorer with Mandelbrot and Julia Set Visualizations<br>
If you are not familiar with fractals please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)<br>

for the code click [her](https://github.com/Natan93100/Coding/blob/main/Fractal%20Explorer%20with%20Mandelbrot%20and%20Julia%20Set%20Visualizations.py)


**Goal:**<br>
The primary goal of this project is to provide an interactive tool to generate, visualize, and explore fractals
Users will be able to:
Visualize these famous fractals with an intuitive graphical interface.
Analyze the mathematical properties of the fractals, such as escape times and iteration counts.
Zoom into specific regions of the fractals to explore their infinite detail and beauty.

**Description:**<br>
This Python project revolves around generating and visualizing complex fractals, primarily focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that repeat at various scales and are often found in natural phenomena.
These fractals are visual representations of sets of points in the complex plane where, after many iterations, the points either escape to infinity or remain bounded.
